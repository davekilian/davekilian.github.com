Networking Blog Posts
=====================

This repository contains the [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) posts
and example / support code for a series of blog posts explaining networking
for first-person shooters.

The target audience is programmers who are comfortable in C++, and who can
write single-player move/shoot controls for first-person shooters without 
breaking a sweat. The goal is to take a simple move/shoot simulation and
network it. 

The networking system is based off what I did for nullZERO, which is based 
on networking in the Source engine (which is in turn based off the networking 
in QuakeWorld).

These posts are in early draft form, and should not be taken seriously (yet).
