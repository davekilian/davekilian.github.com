Brain dump:

Say you're becoming a skip-level manager, so now you're a manager in
charge of other managers. To put it simply, your job is to make sure
those teams work together as effectively as possible.

One way to get started: take a look at your inter-team incentive
structure. Keep an eye out for incentive structures where somebody is
not being held accountable for what they produce. It's not acceptable
for the only incentive to produce high-quality output is not getting
yelled at by another team, since that breeds unnecessary politics.
Instead you want things structured so, if a team produces low-quality
output, the low quality hurts them the most severely and most
immediately. For such a team, the path of least resistance is to do
it right the first time, or to fix problems as soon as they appear.

The nice thing about this is you can do this without having to worry
anything about who works on the team and how they get their work done.
You can consider only what happens if everyone on each team just follows
the path of least resistance. Makes this is useful analysis technique.

This is useful for reducing unnecessary inter-team politics. One common
cause of politics is an imbalanced incentive structure -- you can think
of the politics themselves as an attempt to change the incentive structure.

In small companies / startups, it's not uncommon to have 'full-stack'
teams. As companies grow, though, these teams tend to sub-specialize
into teams which each own parts of the stack and work together to compose
the product. A full-stack team is more likely to get immediately burned
by their own shortcuts, and thus will be less likely to take them if the
risks outweigh the benefits. However, once they start to subspecialize,
you can get into situations where a shortcut on one team burns another
team. Politics are the only way the burned team can de-incentivize the
giver team from taking those kinds of shortcuts.

As an organization grows and teams specialize, it's probably not possible
to eliminate all of these sorts of unaccountable incentive structures,
but it is highly likely some team structures will have less of this kind
of problem than others.

This is also just one factor in the big picture; a team with a perfect
incentivie structure where any bad decision only burns the person who
made the bad decision, can still have other problems, like under-
performers and bad fits. Ultimiately this is a useful tool, but not a 
silver bullet.
