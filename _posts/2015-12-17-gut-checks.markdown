Short one. The basic premise is a gut check can be a useful tool deciding
_against_ doing something, but a gut check alone is not reason enough to do
something. You gut check is a shortcut machine, so it tends to be
example-based. An example doesn't prove your decision is correct, but you can
counter-prove by example.

This is hazy, we probably want to expand a bit
