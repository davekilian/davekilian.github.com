Brain dump

Response to http://blog.dantup.com/2016/04/have-software-developers-given-up/

Once again, let's do a quick mathematical argument.

Once upon an older time, there were fewer programmers than there are today.

Let's say every programmer produces one huge, embarrassing show-stopping but in their entire career. Then the influx of newer developers leads to an uptick in huge embarrassing show stopping bugs, directly

Let's also note that a developer is more likely to create a huge show stopping in an existing, stable, but large and poorly understood codebase. There is more legacy software than there used to be, so there are more bugs where people got tripped up by old code.

This is exacerbated by the web community's preponderance toward dynamic languages where even basic syntax isn't compiled until runtime. The lack of an offline compiler makes it that much harder to touch a sprawling, unknown codebase and come out with the right fix and no regressions

We could just complain that people are lazier today than they were in my day, but that attitude is unproductive. A productive route to attack this problem is to find out if, and they why, software is getting less stable, and decide what we do to fix it.

It's safe to assume most developers don't want to make huge embarrassing show stopping bugs :-)

Or in other words, if your argument hinges on the preimse that everyone but you is (dumb / lazy / insert negative trait here), you probably need to take a closer look at your argument
