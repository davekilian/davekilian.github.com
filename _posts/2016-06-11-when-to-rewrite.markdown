title: When to rewrite

Brain dump

People make this too complicated. It's time to rewrite when

(Time to develop feature on existing code + time to stabilize new feature)

Is greater than

(Time to rewrite code + time to stabilize code + time to add feature to new
code + time to stabilize new feature on new code)

Also note: this applies at all scales, including smaller refractors inside a
codebase
