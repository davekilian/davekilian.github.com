title: Software Estimation is Different

Brain dump:

Think in terms of a normal, non-software engineering role. In those fields, actually building your designs takes time and money, and as a result, it pays dividends to make a detailed plan, outlining to every detail exactly what you plan to do. 

Now think about software. It takes no money to build software, in that there are no material costs. And it takes almost no time to actually write the code -- most programmers can type out code faster than they can think up what to write. The only real cost is the engineer, and the only time taken is what time the engineer spends thinking.

In that case, a full specification of the program is the program itself. That is, if you plan out every detail, down to each line of code, the resulting "plan" is actually the program, your finished product.

That totally changes the nature of estimation, because estimating how long it will take to write and stabilize a piece of software is like estimating how long it will take in a traditional engineering role to come up with a final plan. There are just so many unknowns.

Trying to estimate when a software product will be done is like showing a progress bar for a download you don't know the size of.
