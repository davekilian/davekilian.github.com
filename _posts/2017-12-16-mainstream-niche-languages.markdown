title: Mainstream Niche Programming Languages

The title might sound like a bit of an oxymoron, but basically, there are programming languages that fill an extremely popular 'niche' 

These languges end up looking funny. Why?
When there are no suitable alternatives, you have to solve every problem in that language, whether or not the language is good at that problem.
Ergo, you abuse the languageâ€™s syntax to achieve what you need (js classes, C++ template metaprogramming).
Inevitably, people run into trouble when abusing syntax, and go to the language committee to have their specific problems point fixed.
Some of those end up getting added to the language.
Multiply this by a lot, and you end up with weirdly complex languages with ambiguously parsed syntax/blurred lines between the language syntax and the standard library.

Despite being on somewhat opposite ends of the spectrum, C++ and JavaScript are both good examples:

* It's obvious for JavaScript: it's the only imperative language you can run in a browser
* It's true but less obvious for C++: basically, if you care about memory representation and/or need manual memory management

How can we foster greater competition in these areas?
