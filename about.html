    <p>I'm currently on a career break to care for my young kids (3, 3 and under, baby!).
    Before that, I was a Principal Software Engineer at Microsoft,
    working on improving storage performance for the Azure cloud.
    I graduated from Brown University with a B.S. in Computer Science in 2013.</p>

    <p>I love computer systems! I've spent a few years working on high-performance cloud storage
    networking systems. Back in college, I studied computer graphics, operating systems, networks,
    game engines and more.</p>

    <p>I love to learn and to teach. (You only truly know something if you can teach it
    to someone else!) In my off time, I enjoy going on road trips throughout Washington state
    and hanging around outdoors with my wife and our three little boys.</p>
