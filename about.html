    <p>I am a full-time employee at Microsoft in Seattle, working on Windows deployment. 
    I graduated from Brown University with a B.S. in Computer Science in 2013.
    During my undergrad, I was a TA for 6 classes over 5 semesters.</p>

    <p>I love computer systems. I have experience in computer graphics, game engine
    design, operating system development and computer networking. I've written a SQL
    query or two and have built a few server-centric web apps.</p>

    <p>My current areas of interest include in-browser development, game development,
    computer graphics, and distributed computing. I enjoy learning, distilling,
    teaching and practicing with personal projects.
    In my offtime, I enjoy being outdoors, listening to and playing music,
    and being a couch potato.</p>
