    <p>I'm an Ex-Microsoft principal software engineer with experience designing highly scalable distributed storage systems for the Azure cloud.
    I spent the past year or so on a career break, focusing on my young boys (3, 3 and under, baby!)
    while also earning a public school teaching certificate at night.
    I graduated from Brown University with a B.S. in Computer Science in 2013.</p>

    <p>I love computer systems! I've spent a few years working on high-performance cloud storage and
    networking systems. Back in college, I studied computer graphics, operating systems, networks,
    game engines and more.
    I also love to learn and to teach. (You only truly know something if you can teach it
    to someone else.)</p>

    <p>When I'm offline, I enjoy going on road trips throughout Washington state
    and hanging around outdoors with my wife and our little boys.</p>
