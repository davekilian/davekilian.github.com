    <p>I'm currently working for Microsoft in Seattle, on improving storage performance for the Azure cloud.
    I graduated from Brown University with a B.S. in Computer Science in 2013.
    During my undergrad, I was a teaching assistant for 6 classes over 5 semesters.</p>

    <p>I love computer systems! I've spent the last few years working on high-performance
    cloud storage and networking systems. In college, I loved studying computer graphics,
    operating systems, networks, game engines and more.</p>

    <p>I love to learn and to teach. (You only truly know something if you can teach it
    to someone else!) In my off time, I enjoy going on road trips throughout Washington state
    and hanging around outdoors with my wife and our two little boys.</p>
