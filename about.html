                        <p>I am an undergraduate student studying Computer Science at Brown Univeristy.
                        This year (2012-2013) is my last. After I graduate, I will be working as a 
                        software engineer for Microsoft, working on Windows.</p>

                        <p>I love computer systems. I have experience in computer graphics, game engine
                        design, operating system development and computer networking. I've written a SQL
                        query or two and have built a few server-centric web apps.</p>

                        <p>My current areas of interest include in-browser development, game development,
                        and computer graphics (especially teaching it). The latter is fueled by my work as
                        the head teaching assistant for both of Brown's computer graphics classes
                        (<a href="http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs123">CS123</a> and 
                         <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs224">CS224</a>).</p>

                        <h2>My Story</h2>

                        <p>I was first introduced to Google as a middle-schooler looking for video game cheat codes. I got a whole lot more than I bargained for.</p>

                        <p>My first experiences traversing the 'net fostered a deep interest in computers and computing. I learned what was inside my computer, and assembled one from those parts. I learned how to use search operators to efficiently find whatever I needed. And I became obsessed with freeware. For a period of several months, I used up all the CPU time and disk space on the family computer in my quest to find the perfect settings for a DVD-ripping application I had found online.</p>

                        <p>As an avid free software user and Windows power user, I was naturally inclined to start producing freeware myself. After one or two false starts, I found myself proficient in writing C# programs. I learned all about the .NET technologies of the day, including Winforms, XNA, and MSSQL. With a strong foundation in C#, I had an easy time picking up Java and doing some work in Swing. I would later pass the AP CS exam with flying colors.</p>

                        <p>At the same time, I got hooked on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Now">Security Now!</a>, a podcast about computer security. The very first episode I listened to was an <a href="http://twit.tv/show/security-now/39">explanation of the call stack and buffer overflows</a>. Thanks to <i>Security Now!</i>, I accidentally got a feel for machine architecture before I ever wrote a line of code. I owe a lot of my early knowledge of computer underpinnings to the study of system security. And to Steve Gibson.</p>

                        <p>Several months into my programming career, a friend and I came up with a ludicrous idea for a game called Newman Vs Newman. It was best described as 2D dodgeball with guns, where you play as <i>Newman</i> (from Seinfeld) on his quest to stop Paul Newman and his clone army from obtaining world domination. I ended up with a good reason to port the prototype from C#/XNA to C++/DirectX, and successfully did so despite lacking basic knowledge (at the time, I didn't understand why some C++ types had asterisks next to them ... a lot of sweat and frustration went into that port)</p>

                        <p>I had the good fortune of being selected to attend the <a href="http://www.doe.virginia.gov/instruction/governors_school_programs/index.shtml">Virginia Summer Governor's School for Math, Science, and Technology</a>. I chose to take a class on 3D graphics and game programming there, and met the friend with whom I would later found <a href="http://fracturestudios.com">Fracture</a>. Our two-week C++ prototype of nullZERO could be classified a failure in more ways than one; yet we came out knowing what we wanted to build, and we were determined to learn how to do it right.</p>

                        <p>Back in high school during my senior year, my programming story took an unexpected turn toward the world of web servers, FOSS, and scripting languages. One day after a friend walked into class and drew <a href="http://peebleslab.com/1">a funny comic</a> or <a href="http://peebleslab.com/2">two</a> on the white board, I decided to make them an online home. I built <a href="http://peebleslab.com">Peebles Lab</a> (named after our high school's physics classroom) from scratch using Apache, PHP, and MySQL. We were able to run 100 comics and gain a smidgeon of online fame before we got too busy to continue writing and drawing comics.</p>

                        <p>In 2009 I was accepted into Brown University's class of 2013, and what a ride it's been! At Brown I met many new people and learned so many new things. I consider my education at Brown indispensible. I took classes in a wide range of subjects, from engineering topics like graphics, OSes and networking to more theoretical topics like algorithms, NLP and a brief stint programming functionally.<p>

                        <p>Possibly even more awesome than the things I've learned in class have been the things I've learned out of class. Although Brown CS isn't a huge department by any means, it's chock-full of smart people with lots to share. Over time, my experience molded me into a vim-wielding hacker with the sort of breadth that I would have never been able to teach myself.</p>

                        <p>During my undergrad, I TA'ed a total of five classes: software engineering, computer security, the undergrad class on computer graphics (once as a normal undergrad TA and once as the head TA, who leads the team), and the graduate course on computer graphics. Through my experience TAing, I gained valuable experience developing software and working in teams. I also got a chance to practice my passion of sharing my knowledge with others.</p>

                        <p>After two internships at Microsoft, I am signed on to work with Microsoft full-time. I've yet to see where the future takes me, but things look exciting!</p>
