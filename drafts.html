    <p>This section is a staging area for posts in various stages of development. The content herein is liable to be incomplete or entirely wrong, and can be changed or removed without warning. I use <a href="http://github.com/davekilian/davekilian.github.com">this blog's repo</a> to track work-in-progress posts. Since the drafts already exist publicly anyways, I figured I might as well provide some interface to view them on the live site. Enjoy!</p>
