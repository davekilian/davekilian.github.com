title: Primer&#58; How Computers Work

"How do computers work?"

This question has lead me on a fascinating lifelong journey of learning and discovery. Long ago, I tried to find an answer to this question, but to no avail: there was no shortage of information about computers online, yet no one answer was able to touch on the full answer and tie everything in a neat little bow. I ended up wanting to know more, and following each answer to new questions ended up taking me down my current career path as a software engineer.

It turned out nobody could quite answer the question because there are many little facets to the answer, and understanding them all is one of the key parts of a subfield of computing called **computer systems**.

This online book is a simple primer on computer systems. The computer systems field tends to come off as arcane and arbitrary, and its practitioners can seem wizardlike at times, especially when they manage to pull out one piece of information or a single incantation to make a thorny problem disappear for good. The goal of this book is to make computers seem less magical, and problems more simple.
