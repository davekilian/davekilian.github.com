			<!-- Summary -->
            <p>I'm currently on a career break while I focus on taking care of my very young kids (three, three and under, baby!).<br>
            Before that, I was a Principal Software Engineer for Microsoft, working on storage performance for the Azure cloud.<br>
            I graduated from Brown University with a B.S. in Computer Science in 2013.</p>

            <p>I love computer systems!
            I have experience working on distributed data systems, multithreaded native code optimization, storage drivers,
            RDMA networking, and kernel programming. I also have interests in computer graphics, cryptography and
            operating systems.</p>

            <p>I love to learn and teach! 
            I used to do a well-loved  1&half; hour "boot camp" technical presentation on Azure Storage a few times a year,
            and I was a teaching assistant for 6 classes over 5 semesters during my undergrad.</p>
