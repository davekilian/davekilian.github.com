			<!-- Summary -->
            <p>I am a full-time employee working for Microsoft in Seattle.<br>
            I graduated from Brown University with a B.S. in Computer Science in May of 2013.</p>

            <p>I love computer systems!
            I have experience in graphics, game engines, audio processing, and operating systems.<br>
            Lately I have been interested in learning more about distributed storage, networking and cryptography.</p>

            <p>I'm a quick study, and I love to learn and to teach.</p>

            <p>SDE II on Windows Deployment, August 2013-Present</p>

            <ul>
                <li>After becoming the primary contact for recovery, I lead a ground-up rebuild of Windows's Push-Button Reset feature:
                    I identified design-level issues causing us recurring problems, came up with a design to fix those,
                    proposed it to the team and garnered support, impemented and tested the design, and supported it in market.
                    <br><br>
                    Customers benefit from a halved failure rate, and broader support for automatic error recovery.<br>
                    My team also benefits from a regression test suite which catches problems early,
                    as well as comprehensive telemetry which provides deeper insight into real-world behavior.
                    We now see fewer, much less severe bugs.<br>
                    The flexible design has enabled multiple Windows teams to build their solutions on reset.

			<!-- Technologies -->
			<span class="section-header bottom-border">Technologies</span>

            <p><b>Most proficient:</b> C/C++, C#</p>

            <p>My interest in systems programming keeps bringing me back to these languages.</p>
            <p>
            C# was my first real programming language. I learned to develop using Windows Forms,
            XNA, MSSQL, and many features of the .NET framework.
            My studies in computer graphics and audio helped me learn to write performant C++,
            and my current job lead me to learn more about writing C/C++ applications with a focus on maintainability.
            During my job I set aside some time to learn new features introduced in C+11 and C++14.
            </p>

            <p><b>Also know:</b> Python, Java, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, PHP, Go</p>

            <p>I have used these for non-trivial projects, but it's been long enough I may be rusty.</p>

            <p>I go to Python whenever I need a quick script.
            I picked up Java for coursework, including on Android for a 2D game seminar.
            I built Peebles Lab (see Side Projects) from scratch using HTML, CSS and PHP.
            Recently I've started studying Go, but am not yet very experienced with it.</p>

            <p><b>Other tools, platforms, frameworks:</b> OpenGL, Windows, Git, Qt, Bash</p>
