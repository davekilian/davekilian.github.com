			<!-- Summary -->
            <p>I am a full-time employee working for Microsoft in Seattle.
            I graduated from Brown University with a B.S. in Computer Science in May of 2013.</p>

            <p>I love computer systems. I have experience in computer graphics, game engine design, operating systems and computer networking. 
            My current areas of interest are in-browser development, distributed systems, teaching modern OpenGL,
            building on my existing knowledge, and learning about anything I come in contact with. I learn incredibly quickly.</p>

			<!-- Technologies -->
			<span class="section-header bottom-border">Technologies</span>

            <p>My first real programming language was C#. I learned to develop using Windows Forms,
            XNA, MSSQL, and many features of the .NET framework. Knowing C#, I quickly picked up
            Java and did some work in Swing.</p>

            <p>I have thrown together a few websites in plain HTML / CSS, in some cases adding 
            interactivity with Javascript. I learned PHP and MySQL in order to build server-driven
            web applications.</p>

            <p>Recently I have begun to explore other languages for web development (Rails,
            node.js) but am not greatly experienced in them. I have used Python for a handful
            of class projects.</p>

            <p>My interest in systems programming has led me to learn much about C and C++. I
            have developed several applications and a game engine using the Qt application 
            framework and OpenGL.</p>

            <p>As a TA, I've used Bash scripting and Linux facilities on a few occasions to
            make assignments and systems 'just work' for students.</p>

            <span class="project">tl;dr</span>

            <p>C#, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, PHP, Qt, OpenGL, XNA, Javascript,
            SQL, Ruby on Rails, Python, Bash, Android</p>
