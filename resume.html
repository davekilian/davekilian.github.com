			<!-- Summary -->
            <p>I am a full-time employee working for Microsoft in Seattle.<br>
            I graduated from Brown University with a B.S. in Computer Science in May of 2013.</p>

            <p>I love computer systems!
            I have experience in computer graphics, game engine design, operating systems, and computer networking.
            Lately I have been interested in learning more about distributed storage, networking and cryptography.</p>

            <p>I'm a quick study, and I love to learn and to teach.</p>

			<span style="font-size: 125%">Software Development Engineer, Microsoft</span><br>
            <p>SDE I-SDE II, Windows Deployment: August 2013-Present</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Primary point of contact for Windows consumer recovery features (design, development, testing, support)</li>
                <li>Worked with PC manufacturers to help them customize recovery for their devices</li>
                <li>Advised partner teams and helped them build solutions on our technology</li>
                <li>Onboarded and mentored new team members</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>Lead a ground-up rebuild of Windows's Push-Button Reset feature from start to finish:
                    I identified design-level issues causing recurring problems, came up with a design to fix those,
                    proposed it to the team and garnered support, impemented and tested the design, and supported it in market.
                    <br><br>
                    Benefits realized include halving the failure rate,
                    broader support for automatically recovering from failures,
                    a high-quality regression test suite which catches new problems early,
                    and deeper insight about in-market behavior via improved device telemetry.
                    We immediately had fewer bugs, and the severity of those bugs fell drastically.
                </li>
            </ul>

			<!-- Technologies -->
			<span class="section-header bottom-border">Technologies</span>

            <p>My first real programming language was C#. I learned to develop using Windows Forms,
            XNA, MSSQL, and many features of the .NET framework. Knowing C#, I quickly picked up
            Java and did some work in Swing.</p>

            <p>My interest in systems programming has led me to learn much about C and C++. I
            have developed several applications and a game engine using the Qt application 
            framework and OpenGL. I have much experience with C++ on Windows from my recent
            work experience, during which I set aside time to learn new features introduced in
            C++11 and C++14. When I need something quick 'n dirty, I usually go to Python.</p>

            <p>I have thrown together a few websites in plain HTML / CSS, in some cases adding 
            interactivity with Javascript. I learned PHP and MySQL in order to build server-driven
            web applications. Later I explored more modern web development tools (Rails,
            node.js) but am not greatly experienced in them.</p>

            <p><b>tl;dr: </b>C++, C#, Python, Java, HTML, CSS, PHP, Qt, OpenGL, XNA, JavaScript, SQL, Windows, Bash, Android</p>
