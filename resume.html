			<!-- Summary -->
            <p>I currently work for Microsoft in Seattle, on improving storage performance for the Azure cloud.<br>
            I graduated from Brown University with a B.S. in Computer Science in May of 2013.</p>

            <p>I love computer systems!
            I have experience working on distributed systems, multithreaded native code optimization, storage drivers,
            RDMA networking, kernel programming and computer graphics.</p>

            <p>I also love to learn and teach! 
            I do a 1&half; hour technical overview presentation on Azure Storage a few times a year for new developers,
            and I was also a teaching assistant for 6 classes over 5 semesters during my undergrad.</p>

			<!-- Technologies -->
			<span class="section-header bottom-border">Technology Experience</span>

            <p><b>Most recently:</b> C/C++, Windows Drivers, RDMA</p>

            <p>These are my bread and butter in my current job role, so they're all still top of mind.</p>

            <p><b>In the past:</b> OpenGL, Qt, Python, Java, Linux shells, C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL</b></p>

            <p>I have used these for nontrivial projects, but it's been long enough I may be rusty.</p>

            <p><b>Also dabbled with:</b> Rust, Go, Ruby</p>

            <p>I've played around with these in my free time, but haven't had the opportunity to build something notable.</p>
